    It is a period of civil war.
    Rebel spaceships, striking
    from a hidden base, have won
    their first victory against
    the evil Galactic Empire.
    
    During the battle, Rebel
    spies managed to steal secret
    plans to the Empire's
    ultimate weapon, the DEATH
    STAR, an armored space
    station with enough power
    to destroy an entire planet.
    
    Pursued by the Empire's
    sinister agents, Princess
    Leia races home aboard her
    starship, custodian of the
    stolen plans that can save her
    people and restore
    freedom to the galaxy....
